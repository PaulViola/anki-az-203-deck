# Why an Anki deck?

As of the creation of this repository, I've been using spaced repetition for a little over a year as an efficient way of remembering things that I learn.  Spaced repetition attempts to exploit one's "forgetting curve" to get the most learning from the least effort by scheduling what you study in gradually increasing intervals.  You can read more about spaced repetition [here](https://collegeinfogeek.com/spaced-repetition-memory-technique/)

# Additional Resources

This deck is not intended to be a standalone resource in studying for the AZ-203, but as a supplement to help retain learnings from other sources such as the following:

* Isaac Levin's [Study Guide](https://www.isaaclevin.com/post/az-203-study-guide/)
* Pluralsight's [AZ-203 Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/developing-solutions-for-microsoft-azure-az-203)
