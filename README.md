# Why an Anki deck?

Prior to creating this repository, I've been using spaced repetition for a little over a year as an efficient way of remembering things that I learn.  Spaced repetition attempts to exploit one's "forgetting curve" to get the most learning from the least effort by scheduling what you study in gradually increasing intervals.  You can read more about spaced repetition [here](https://collegeinfogeek.com/spaced-repetition-memory-technique/)
